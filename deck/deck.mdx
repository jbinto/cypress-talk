  <Appear>
    <li>📖 Cypress ships an example test suite for a "real world" app</li>
    <li><code>conduit</code> is a Medium clone, a learning project cloned in over a dozen languages</li>

# What drove us to Cypress?

<ul>
  <h3>Component tests with `enzyme` shallow rendering are fragile</h3>

    <li>💥 Tests would still pass even if the app is broken</li>

  <li>🗑 Tests weren't useful for verifying dependency upgrades</li>
  <Appear>
    <li>😰 Refactoring meant re-writing most or all of the tests</li>
    <li>💰 Which means our tests didn't pay for themselves</li>

# Test "like a user" to enable refactoring

Our mistake was testing <strong>implementation details</strong>.

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>🚧 The internals of React were entirely rewritten between React 15 and React 16</li>
    <li>👩‍🔬 They only tested their public APIs
      <ul>
        <li>Tests didn't need to be rewritten</li>
        <li>And they actually verified things still worked</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>💻For a web application, <em>the user interface</em> is the public API</li>

# Cypress is designed for reliability

<Appear>
  <li>🕴 It hides the complexities of async</li>
  <li>🚫 You can always* write deterministic, flake-free tests</li>

# Cypress has great documentation

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>🔤 <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Cypress-Can-Be-Simple-Sometimes">It's simple (sometimes)</a></li>
    <li>👮‍♂️  But in order to guarantee reliability, you need to follow rules</li>
    <li>👨‍🎓 You may need to unlearn the way you've tested in other environments</li>
    <li>📚 Read the docs to learn more!</li>

# The tests themselves

<Appear>
  <li>🧙‍♂️ Stub out REST API calls with <code>cy.route()</code></li>
  <li>🏗️ Stub out browser APIs (or your own app's APIs!) with <code>cy.stub()</code></li>
  <li>🕰 Fast-forward in-app timers with <code>cy.tick()</code></li>
  <li>⚙️ Write arbitrary tasks in Node with <code>cy.task()</code></li>
  <li>🕸 Make web requests with <code>cy.request()</code></li>
  <li>⏭</li>
</Appear>

# The test runner

<Appear>
  <li>⌚️ You can view snapshots, "before"/"after" of each test step</li>
  <li>🔓 You can access the console, and interact with your app</li>
  <li>🎥 You can record screenshots and videos of test runs</li>
  <li>🧾 You can get code coverage metrics</li>

# Why you (maybe) shouldn't use Cypress

Nothing is perfect. Some areas Cypress is working on:

<ul>
  <li>No Firefox support - <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1096">GH #1096</a></li>
  <li>Full network stubbing (fetch support) - <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/687">GH #687</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security.html#External-Navigation">One "superdomain" per test</a></li>
</ul>
