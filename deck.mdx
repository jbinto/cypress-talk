# Cypress is designed for reliability

<Appear>
  <li>✅ It helps you avoid timing bugs with <em>retry-ability</em></li>
  <li>🚫 You can always* write deterministic, flake-free tests...</li>
  <li>⏳ ...and you never* have to write manual "wait for 1000ms"</li>
  <li>👨‍⚖️ ...if you follow the rules. Don't worry, Cypress has great documentation!</li>

# Tradeoffs for reliability

<Appear>
  <li>It's JavaScript, but not like you're used to</li>
  <li>You can't write <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/conditional-testing.html">conditional tests</a>: no branching or logic allowed</li>
  <li>But you have options. Did I mention Cypress has great documentation?</li>

# The tests themselves

<Appear>
  <li>🧙‍♂️ Stub out REST API calls with <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/route.html#Making-multiple-requests-to-the-same-route"><code>cy.route()</code></a></li>
  <li>🏗️ Stub out browser APIs (or your own app's APIs!) with <code>cy.stub()</code></li>
  <li>🕰 Fast-forward in-app timers with <code>cy.tick()</code></li>
  <li>⚙️  Call <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-realworld/blob/e3d4a12437851a40770ddbc90fbed65a3e7ca9ba/cypress/plugins/index.js#L13">arbitrary tasks</a> in Node with <code>cy.task()</code></li>

# The test runner

<Appear>
  <li>⌚️ You can view snapshots, "before"/"after" of each test step</li>
  <li>🔓 You can access the console, and interact with your app</li>
  <li>🎥 You can record screenshots and videos of test runs</li>
  <li>🧾 You can get code coverage metrics</li>

# Why you (maybe) shouldn't use Cypress

Nothing is perfect. Some areas Cypress is working on:

<ul>
  <li>No Firefox support - <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1096">GH #1096</a></li>
  <li>Full network stubbing (fetch support) - <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/687">GH #687</a>, workarounds</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security.html#External-Navigation">One "superdomain" per test</a>, workarounds</li>
</ul>

# Read the docs!

  <li>Some of the best technical writing I've encountered</li>
